Use `productWeightGrams`, `productWastePercentage`, and `unitProductCFLb` to generate:
- A summary of material efficiency, including waste per product (`potentialWastePerProductGrams`) and total waste (`totalPotentialWasteGrams`)
- A sentence stating the material CO₂ contribution per unit and as a percentage of the total
- A doughnut chart showing:
  - CO₂ from material use
  - CO₂ from waste
- A recommendation: "Consider reducing waste from 4% to 2% through design optimization or recycled input."
