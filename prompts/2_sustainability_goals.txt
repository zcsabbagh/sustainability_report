If a specific sustainability goal is present, include it as a quote. 
If not, assume a 5% annual CO₂ reduction goal and a 1.25% quarterly target. 
Use `sumCarbonFootprintInGrams` (or total lbs/MT from the last quarter) and `quantity` to calculate the current footprint. Display:
- A sentence comparing current footprint to last quarter’s (if available)
- A table showing:
  | Metric | Value |
  |--------|-------|
  | Total Emissions This Quarter | `X MT CO₂e` |
  | Target Emissions | `Y MT CO₂e` |
  | Δ from Goal | `Z MT` or `% Over/Under` |


- A progress bar or line chart showing quarterly emissions vs goal over time
