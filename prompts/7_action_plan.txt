Create a short bullet list of prioritized actions based on the top 2-3 emission sources. For each one, generate:
- Estimated COâ‚‚ savings
- Cost-saving potential (if known)
- Time to implement (e.g., "immediate", "next quarter")

Example format:
ðŸ”§ Action Plan:
- Switch to renewable power (â†“70% factory COâ‚‚, immediate)
- Reuse pallets (â†“60% packaging COâ‚‚, implement in Q3)
- Optimize shipment frequency (â†“30% logistics COâ‚‚, pilot in Q2)
