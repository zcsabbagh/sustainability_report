Using `monthlyPowerCFLb`, `monthlyEmployeeDrivingCFLb`, and factory breakdown percentages (e.g., Power: 94%, Employee: 6%), generate:
- A pie chart showing the relative contributions of Power, Gas, and Employee Commute
- A table:
  | Source | COâ‚‚ (lbs) | % of Factory Emissions |
  |--------|-----------|------------------------|
- A recommendation sentence for each component with >10% contribution (e.g., "Power contributes 94% of factory emissions. 
Switching to solar could reduce this by 70%.")
